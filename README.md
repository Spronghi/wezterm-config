# wezterm config

[Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) config tht replicates what I was used to do with tmux. This configuration goes together with the [neovim config](https://github.com/Spronghi/nvim-config).

## Why Wezterm over tmux?

The only functionality I was using from tmux was actually the tab and pan management, no sessions or stuff like that. Becuse of that I've decided to remove one tool to have less configurations, since wezterm is really easy to personalise based on your need, both for WSL and MacOS.

## Configuration

The configuration is a mix between tmux and Mac shortcuts.

Remember to install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install) with the [simple](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#simple) theme.

## Fonts

My favorite font is [Cascadia Mono](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).
